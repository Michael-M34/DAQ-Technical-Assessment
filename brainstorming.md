# Brainstorming

P1:

Crash happens when JSON sent with incorrect syntax (+ "}" line). Used try-catch so that issue doesn't cause program to crash but doesn't get ignored.

P2:

Assuming that when invalid json is provided, safe value is given to temp values list. Bad assumption in practice
This array method also assumes that the sampling rate is 0.5Hz

Also resets the count after it prints to incidents.log to avoid "unecessary repeats"

P3: 

Red if outside Green if in
Tried different text colour transitions
